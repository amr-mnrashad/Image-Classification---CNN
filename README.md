# Image-Classification-CNN
The aim of this project is to develop a neural network to perform binary classification on the given Cats & Dogs images dataset. The main type of neural network that will be focused on is convolutional neural network (CNN), where I try exploring different network architectures, tunning various hyperparameters and applying 5-fold cross validation in order to compute the risk estimates of the selected model. To determine the best performing CNN, I have applied different models and introduced regularization methods in order to avoid overfitting.
I come to the conclusion that the best experimented performing CNN architecture is composed of 4 convolutional layers with image size 100x100.
